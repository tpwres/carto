You can switch the map between basic view and the more advanced OpenStreetMap. Note, that OSM offers a greater zoom in/out range.

Pin colours correspond to promotions; white pin indicates that more than one promotion used a given venue. An "X" inside a pin denotes a historical venue, no longer in use by the federation.
